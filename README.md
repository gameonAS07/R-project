Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using R 
Introduction 
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine 
the emotional tone behind a text. In this project, we use R to extract Twitter data using 
the rtweet package and analyze sentiment using tidytext. 
Prerequisites 
Before starting, install the required packages in R: rtweet, tidytext, dplyr, and 
ggplot2. 
Step 1: Fetch Twitter Data 
Using the rtweet package, we can connect to Twitter’s API and extract tweets based 
on a specific keyword. We ensure that only English tweets are selected for analysis. 
Step 2: Text Cleaning and Sentiment Analysis 
Once we have the raw tweets, we preprocess the text by removing stop words and 
unnecessary characters. The sentiment analysis is performed using predefined lexicons 
such as Bing and NRC, which classify words as positive, negative, or belonging to 
specific emotions. 
Step 3: Visualizing Sentiment Distribution 
After categorizing words based on sentiment, we visualize the sentiment distribution 
using bar charts to understand the general sentiment of the collected tweets. 
Conclusion 
We successfully extracted tweets and performed sentiment analysis. This project can be 
expanded by applying machine learning models for more refined classification.

Introduction 
Stock price analysis helps investors understand market trends. In this project, we use 
the quantmod package to fetch stock data and perform moving average analysis. 
Prerequisites 
To perform stock price analysis, we use the quantmod and TTR packages. 
Step 1: Fetch Stock Data 
We retrieve stock data from online sources such as Yahoo Finance. The data includes 
daily opening and closing prices, trading volume, and other key indicators. 
Step 2: Calculate Moving Averages 
Moving averages help smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. The 50-day and 
200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are commonly used indicators in stock 
analysis. 
Step 3: Visualizing Stock Prices with Moving Averages 
By plotting stock prices along with moving averages, we can observe trends and identify 
potential buy/sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the 
long-term moving average, it is often considered a bullish signal, whereas the opposite 
indicates a bearish trend. 
Conclusion 
We successfully analyzed Apple’s stock prices using moving averages. This project can 
be extended by applying predictive models like ARIMA for forecasting.
